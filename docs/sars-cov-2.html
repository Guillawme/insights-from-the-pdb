<h2>About this section</h2>
<p>With the ongoing <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">COVID-19
pandemic</a>, new structures of proteins from <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2">SARS-CoV-2</a>
are deposited to the PDB at a fast pace. The visualizations presented
here won’t help curb the pandemic (and are not medical advice,
obviously), but I hope they will make curious and helpless minds (like
myself) get a feel for the research effort currently being deployed
against it.</p>

<p>Noticeable very large numbers of depositions on a same day (for
example, 68 structures deposited on March 15th and 14 structures
deposited on April 7th) come from large-scale fragment screening
