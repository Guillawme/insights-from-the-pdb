title: "Insights from the PDB"

[![DOI badge][doi-badge]][doi-link]

**Last updated on `r date()`.**

The [Protein Data Bank][pdb] (PDB) is a repository of experimentally determined
three-dimensional structures of biological macromolecules (mostly proteins and
nucleic acids). The structures it contains are very useful by themselves for
answering biological questions, or for asking even more questions. In addition,
the associated *metadata* (structure annotations) can also answer many
interesting questions.

The PDB already provides [statistics on some of its metadata][pdb-stats], but
these are very general in scope. The [PDB in Europe][pdbe] (PDBe) provides
programmatic access to the database through the [PDBe API][pdbe-search]. By
collecting appropriate metadata from the database, one can get much finer
insight, for example specific to a particular field of structural biology.

This website presents the results of analyzing metadata from the Protein Data
Bank to answer questions I am interested in. Some of these analyses are part of
[a series of posts on my blog][blog]; this website consolidates the results in a
format that is easier to keep up-to-date and consult. I will add more analyses
as I find the need. Each analysis indicates the date when it was last run, and I
will try to update the entire site about once a month. If you notice it is out
of date, feel free to [contact me][contact] and I will update it.

You are free to use all figures and code used to generate them, [provided you
give credit appropriately][permissions].
